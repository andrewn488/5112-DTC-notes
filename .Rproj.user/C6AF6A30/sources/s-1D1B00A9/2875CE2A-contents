This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)

# read a dta file:
sec0a <- read_dta("02_raw_data/sec0a.dta")
View(sec0a)
summary(sec0a)

# correlation coefficients of variables
sec0a_cor <- cor(sec0a) 
# round to 2 decimal points
round(sec0a_cor, 2) 

# regression of sec0a
sec0a_reg <- lm(formula = region ~ dwell + eanum + loc2 + loc5 + loc3, data = sec0a)
summary(sec0a_reg)

# standardized errors:
hist(rstandard(sec0a_reg),
     xlab = "Standardized residuals")

# residual vs. fitted
plot(fitted(sec0a_reg), 
     resid(sec0a_reg), 
     xlab = "Fitted", 
     ylab = "Residuals", 
     title("Residual vs. Fitted - Regression 1"))

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
